This project uses various machine learning models to detect fradulent transactions.
It has two versions.

## Dataset
This project uses the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.
The dataset is too large and could not be included in this repository due to github's size restrictions.  
To run the notebooks, please download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place `creditcard.csv` in the same folder as the notebooks.
